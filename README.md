# Blah Blog!

This is a personal website / blog web application written in scala.

This project is meant to be a playground for scala, scala-related libraries, and web 2.0 / html 5 technologies

Go to the [live website](http://davezhu.com) to see this app in action.

## TODO:
- Publish blogs through GitHub- will pull from blog repo
- Explore server-side push technologies (websocket, ajax long-poll, socket.io,
  etc) - will developer a real time stock/commodity price ticker with level-II
  prices (but with a 1 minute delay)
- Blog searching through [ES](http://www.elasticsearch.org) / lucene.
- Explore neo4j a bit more, with relaton to data-mining


Some of the tools/libraries/frameworks used (or may be used in the future):

- [scala](http://scala-lang.org/)
- [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/) for build management
- [akka](http://akka.io/) (TODO)
- [unfiltered](https://github.com/unfiltered/unfiltered) (with filter, jetty, scalate)
- [scalate](http://scalate.fuseource.org) with [jade](http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/jade.html)
- [prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify) (TODO)
- couchdb (through scouchdb) (TODO)
- [svgweb](http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/) for cross-browser (mainly IE problems) rendering of SVG - so logos looks great on the new retina display Macbook (and similarly high res displays)
- [cufon](http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/) for rendering fonts on IE..
